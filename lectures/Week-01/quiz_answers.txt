1. False.

2. 3rd Generation languages allow some independence from hardware for example in c by having a pointer datatype we don't need to worry about the actual memory details on a particular architecture - the compiler handles that for us. 

3. False
Pi is declared a double but the resulting calculation is then stored in a float.

4. Yes, the ascii value of 4 is stored and the printf statement putputs 4.

5. Yes, outputs -4.000000

6. No, this IS a valid declaration and does not produce a warning. 6.5 is truncated to fit and the printf statement outputs 6.

7. A Struct. This is because potentially a student record will contain information of several different types. The student number might be an int, the name would be a char array etc. 

8. Either 0 or 1. C has no boolean type and the order of operations in c means that the comparison operator is evaluated before the assignment operator.

9. False.

10. 5, because of the order of operations. (Follows bodmas) 

11. 39

12. 14, because the order of evaluation for assignments flows left to right.

13. 101, the increment takes place before the assignment.

14. True

15. True

16. Memory on the stack is reclaimed when the code exits the block in which it is valid.
