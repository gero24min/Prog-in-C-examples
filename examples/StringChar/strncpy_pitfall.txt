It is important to note that strcpy() or strncpy() do not explicitly
terminate the string (in which the characters are copied into) with a
null character.

This fact can be ignored when using strcpy() function mainly because,
strcpy() copies all the characters of the source string (text2 in
strcpy_1.c) into the destination string (text1 in strcpy_1.c). ie. it
also copies the null character of the source string into the
destination string.  Whereas when, strncpy() is used, only a specified
number (3 in strncpy_2.c) of characters are copied from the source
string to destination string.  Due to which the null character may not
necessarily be copied into the destination string (text1). 

This should explain the reason why the output of 'text1' in
strncpy_2.c is 'Tesple' instead of expected 'Tes'. The 'ple' of the
original string still remains in the array. ie. text1 is not null
terminated after 3 characters.

The remedy for this should be, after strncpy() one could explicitly
null terminate the string :

    text1[n] = '\0';

where 'n' is the value passed as the third parameter of strncpy()
function.  (in case of strncpy_2. n=3)
