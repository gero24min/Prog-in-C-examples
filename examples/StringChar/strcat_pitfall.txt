When using strcat(), the programmer should ensure that the space allocated
to the first (destination) string is large enough to store the 
concatenated string.

Like in the code strcat_1.c, there is a potential problem since there is no
checking done of the lengths of the two strings. A potentially better way 
is shown in strcat_2.c.
